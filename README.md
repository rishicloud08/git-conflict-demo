\# Git Merge Conflict Demonstration



\## Objective

To demonstrate Git version control by creating branches, introducing a merge conflict, and resolving it.



\## Repository Setup

\- A Git repository was initialized locally.

\- A text file (file.txt) was added and committed to the master branch.



\## Branch Creation

\- Created two branches:

&nbsp; - feature-A

&nbsp; - feature-B



\## Changes Made

\- In feature-A, the same line in file.txt was modified.

\- In feature-B, the same line in file.txt was modified differently.



\## Merge Conflict

\- While merging feature-A into master, Git detected a conflict because both branches modified the same line.

\- Git marked the conflict inside file.txt.



\## Conflict Resolution

\- The conflicting markers were manually removed.

\- The correct final content was chosen.

\- The file was added and committed to complete the merge.



\## Result

\- Merge conflict was successfully resolved.

\- Complete commit history is available in the repository.
